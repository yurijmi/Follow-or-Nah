12th app of [Nick's and Jenna's iOS 9 course](https://www.udemy.com/ios-9-swift-2-xcode-7-make-an-app-programming-code-ios9-dev/)

Build target: iOS 8.0, iPhone only, Landscape only

### Changes from course version of the app:
* All possible crashes are fixed:
  * Crash from Twitter's API rate limit;
  * Crash from Twitter's API's error;
  * Crash from fast user interaction.
* End Credits View;
* Different (and more Apple guidelinish) approach for selecting Twitter account;
* More appealing interface with animations;
* Errors don't crash the app or printing stuff to console. The're displayed to user in UIAlertViews;
* Code is more readable than Nick's in the course;
* More information is shown about user. Such as:
  * Bigger profile picture;
  * Followers count;
  * If he/she follows you or not.

Code was modified by me. Original code was made by Nick Walter.
